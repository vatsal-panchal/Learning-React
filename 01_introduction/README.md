## 🟦 Why was React created?

Facebook was facing a big problem:

- Notifications, reactions, and messages were **not updating in real time**
- Users had to **reload the page again and again**
- At that time, Facebook was using **PHP + traditional DOM**
- Even for a small change, the **entire page was re-rendered** → very slow

In **2013**, a Facebook engineer **Jordan Walke** created a solution:

➡️ **React**

## ✨ What makes React special?

- React does **not directly update the real DOM**
- It keeps its own **Virtual DOM**
- Virtual DOM is a **lightweight copy** of the real DOM
- When something changes, **only the changed part** is updated in the real DOM
- The full page does **not refresh** → UI becomes fast and real-time

# 1️⃣ What is React?

## 1. Definition

React is a **JavaScript library** used to build **User Interfaces (UI)**.

## 2. Developer

Developed by **Facebook (Meta)**.

## 3. Architecture

React uses a **component-based architecture**:

- The UI is broken into **small, reusable parts** called components.

## 4. Speed

React uses **Virtual DOM**.

### Benefits:

- Only the **changed part** is re-rendered
- The whole UI is **not refreshed**
- The app feels **fast and smooth**

## 5. SPA Support

With React, we can build **Single Page Applications (SPA)**:

- No full page reload
- Content updates **dynamically**
- User experience is **very smooth**

## 6. Focus

React handles only the **UI (View layer)**.

For other things like:

- Data handling
- Routing
- Backend

we use **other tools and libraries**.

## 🔍 Example (Theory): WhatsApp Web

Imagine the WhatsApp Web interface:

- Header → a component
- Chat list → a component
- Chat window → a component

When you send a message:

- Only the **Chat window** updates
- Header and Chat list **do not change**

This is exactly how **component-based structure + Virtual DOM** works.

## ⭐ Key Takeaways

- React = **Fast, component-based UI library**
- Virtual DOM = **Smart DOM updates → only changed parts are updated**
- No page reload → **SPA behavior**
- React was created to solve **Facebook’s real-time performance problems**
